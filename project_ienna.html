<h2 style="text-align:center;color:B5705F;font-size:200%">Overview <h2/>
<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;text-align:center"> IENNA Application with the capabilities of accessing your Google Timeline and predicting which direction you will be heading each day of the week,<br> as well as what stops you will make, thus making the each travel to and from work more efficient. We live in the age of autonomous Fridges and Coffee makers where our appliances <br>are capable ordering directly from the Internet and yet we are stuck manually programming each route into our phones. This is far away from Ai Assistant as the Ai itself.<br> For the purposes of this scenario I will here after refer to Ai in the context of Algorithm Interpretation, as thats all it really is. </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;color:B5705F;font-size:200%">Motivation <h2/>
<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;text-align:center"> Google Maps has the feature to add spots into your route but doesn’t use Time line rather POI (points of interest) such as Restaurants or Cafes.<br> This would act as a sort of Ai Personal Assistant. Generally speaking we all have our morning routines before we leave our homes. <br>And seeing how this part of our life has become an autonomous part on our brains behalf. This would take over the next step and would only act as a D2D (door to door) service. <br>It would use machine learning to figure out your travel routine and customise few optimisations to save you time including inputting this information yourself. </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;color:B5705F ;font-size:200%">Description <h2/>
<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;text-align:center"> IENNA Application would use permission style access to Google Timeline, Maps, Drive, Calendar, Alarm. The application would run from a folder named IENNA in the users Google Drive,<br> or similar Cloud network of the users choosing, where it would keep its user data and calculated, optimised routes based on the day of the week. It would also access the Calendar and based on your appointments work them<br> into your schedule, should they differ in time travel and alike from day to day allowing for change in Alarm patterns and so on. It would have a Holiday module by default when you travel outside of your home City <br>and the ability to differentiate when said travels are for Businesses, or not and set alarms accordingly. The premise for the learning is its Shadow Mode. Your behaviour is circumstantial is at forefront of its customisation <br>this will always be looking for slight changes in your behaviour and try and learn from its mistakes. As this data is purely owned and controlled by the user we put them in the control of their own lives with the<br> autonomous help of their phone. More additions to this type of technology is expected if the product is well received. For example in the direction of marketing and product purchases. But the power to control <br>your own Assistant and not to be controlled by the marketing propaganda. For instance purchasing a perishable or limited life item online could have IENNA ask: "Do you need to buy X product again?",<br> with a "yes" or "no" prompt only. Not an add with pricing and options to go and make the purchase directly from the add banner. But rather a casual reminder, as it would be with a real life Assistant. <br>The app is meant to give back the user the control of their time starting with time they leave home and get to work. And not impose on them, as well asnot imposing more frequent add spots. <br>We need to stopped wasting time on reading adds and making involuntary purchases based on strategic marketing tackticks. Trully a way to improve human<br> and IoT interaction not just add to the pot of applications with same drive (money) and little to no substance.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;color:B5705F;font-size:200%">Tools and Technology <h2/>
<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;text-align:center"> As I my self would not be able to code an application from scratch I’m thinking that MIT Application Inventor would help with the UI (User Interface) and that <br>I can figure out the rest with some youtube tutorials. We are blessed with the wast knowledge resources when it comes to programming one just has to be persistent. <br>This will be and Android, iOS, Kai OS, Firefox OS and Linux and alike app to accommodate for the majority of Mobile Phone along with other portable/wearable devices at present. <br>My goal would be a Web Applet build to save on resources in order to be as transparent as possible.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;color:B5705F;font-size:200%">Skills Required <h2/>
<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;text-align:center"> Full Stack development team with the ability to create necessary repositories in the user own Google Drive which the Ai Assistant will have access to. <br>As this would be a combination of exiting technologies in a new way. A compilation of exiting technological micro applets to create a new service. Most of the heavier structure<br> as in the Ai machine learning would be a Open Source version. As this doesn’t need to be proprietary at this point and the cost of rebuilding this particular wheel wouldn’t be feasible. </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;color:B5705F;font-size:200%">Outcome <h2/>
<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;text-align:center"> Siri, Alexa, Ok Google, Cortana are heavy and cumbersome applications at present this would free up people from being a part of Big Data as all their information would be stored <br>on their local Google Drive or similar cloud service of their choice. I have no use for the data of our customers and would offload the duty of care to them. It would be a free app with<br> banner adds and a few dollars for the add-free version should the app prove useful to the user. The underlying philosophy would be to help people and create a working<br> relationship with a company who is the business of providing a service old school way in this new age of IoT. </p>
