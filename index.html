<h1 style="text-align:center;color:green;font-size:250%">Interest in IT <h1/>

<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;margin: 0px 400px"> My main interest in IT would be Reverse Engineering, Information Security and DevOps. I also like working with hardware Raspberry Pi, Digispark and alike. </p></br>
<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;margin: 0px 400px"> My interest in IT started originally taking old electronic equipment at a very young age (6 or 7) I would always want to know what was inside and how things worked. The idea behind the product retrospectively speaking. I Minored in Software Design and Development in High School in year 11 and 12. Since then I have been Web Admin for all my business ventures, first site back in 2005 was edited in Dreamweaver from a $30 template. These days I use Squarespace. Times have changed and being a self-employed since High School time management has become a valuable skill, and the product is harder to sell when its a Service. That requires real world personal relationships with Merchant and Customer. So my priorities are not in self coding websites but rather in Branding.</p></br>
<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;margin: 0px 400px"> I’m studying at RMIT a <bold>Bachelor</bold> of <italic>Information Technology</italic> trough OUA. Fully online as it was best  suited for me at this time in my and my families life. This avenue enabled me to pursue the course of study I otherwise wouldn’t have had the opportunity to do.</p></br>
<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;margin: 0px 400px">Skills that will make me Employment ready. As with most Occupations the idea is networking as you can not inevitably become the best at any one thing, its good to share your individual skills and talents with like minded people around you. To put it simply one pair of hands can accomplish a lot in one day or a month, but if increase the work power to 10 pairs then you gain speed, and in today’s day and  age isn’t that what IT stands for, speed and propagation of information.   </p></br>

<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;margin: 0px 400px"> High level Software integration Engineer. Testing new technology limits and working on current and future of IoT. There are available consulting positions for a DevOps role which would be great after a few years of gained experience at a position like the one mentioned above. As I would like the flexibility of working from home eventually. </p></br>

<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;margin: 0px 400px"> As the ad states it asks for 5  - 8 year in IT. This being a combination of Networking and Programming skills outlined along with job specific tool proficiency. </p></br>

<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;margin: 0px 400px"> High School Minor in Software Design and Development. Currently in the research stage of setting up a Web/Cloud base server for my business. Which I hope to expand to hosting server as a side income project.</p></br>

<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;margin: 0px 400px"> Apart from RMIT and the above mentioned private project, I’m in-rolled in CompTIA Security+ and CompTIA Linux+ XK0-004 courses getting me more in depth knowledge in the Linux systems Admin side helpful for the role I’m looking for and with the side project I’m working on at home. I’m also looking to become a Linux power user over the next few year whiles studying the Degree to aid in the process of being career ready.</p></br>

<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;margin: 0px 400px"> Based on the results of my tests above and experience of being self employed for over 15 years now I have developed more of a managerial approach to problem solving as im the head lead at our family company. So looking at the big picture is important and carries with it a lot of responsibility. I have always been a keen believer in team effort as I grew up with the mentality of working in a family business. In the team scenario I will maybe try and be direct and try and make major decisions relatively quickly early in the assignment. So as to give people plenty of time to work on their part of the project. Slow and in-decisive meetings will only hold up the production process and we are on a time schedule. Depending on the scenario and my position in the team I would try and give plenty of justifications for my arguments in order to help speed up brain storming sessions. </p></br></br>
