<h1 style="text-align:center;color:green;font-size:250%">Interest in IT <h1/>

<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;text-align:center"> My main interest in IT would be Reverse Engineering, Information Security and DevOps. <br>I also like working with hardware Raspberry Pi, Digispark and alike. </p>
<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;text-align:center"> My interest in IT started originally taking old electronic equipment at a very young age (6 or 7)<br> I would always want to know what was inside and how things worked. The idea behind the product <br>retrospectively speaking. I Minored in Software Design and Development in High School in year 11 and 12.<br> Since then I have been Web Admin for all my business ventures, first site back in 2005 was edited <br>in Dreamweaver from a $30 template. These days I use Squarespace. Times have changed and <br>being a self-employed since High School time management has become a valuable skill, and <br> the product is harder to sell when its a Service. That requires real world personal relationships <br> with Merchant and Customer. So my priorities are not in self coding websites but rather in Branding.</p>
<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;text-align:center"> I’m studying at RMIT a <bold>Bachelor</bold> of <italic>Information Technology</italic> trough OUA. Fully online as it was best <br> suited for me at this time in my and my families life. This avenue enabled me to pursue the course of <br> study I otherwise wouldn’t have had the opportunity to do.</p>
<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;text-align:center">Skills that will make me Employment ready. As with most Occupations the idea is networking as you can not<br> inevitably become the best at any one thing, its good to share your individual skills and talents with like <br>minded people around you. To put it simply one pair of hands can accomplish a lot in one day or a month, <br>but if increase the work power to 10 pairs then you gain speed, and in today’s day and <br> age isn’t that what IT stands for, speed and propagation of information.   </p>

<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;text-align:center"> High level Software integration Engineer. Testing new technology limits and working on current and future<br> of IoT. There are available consulting positions for a DevOps role which would be great after a few <br>years of gained experience at a position like the one mentioned above. As I would like the <br>flexibility of working from home eventually. </p>

<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;text-align:center"> As the ad states it asks for 5  - 8 year in IT. This being a combination of Networking and Programming <br>skills outlined along with job specific tool proficiency. </p>

<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;text-align:center"> High School Minor in Software Design and Development. Currently in the research stage of setting up a <br>Web/Cloud base server for my business. Which I hope to expand to hosting server as a side income project.</p>

<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;text-align:center"> Apart from RMIT and the above mentioned private project, I’m in-rolled in CompTIA Security+ and CompTIA Linux+ XK0-004 <br>courses getting me more in depth knowledge in the Linux systems Admin side helpful<br> for the role I’m looking for and with the side project I’m working on at home. I’m also looking to<br> become a Linux power user over the next few year whiles studying the Degree to aid in the<br> process of being career ready.</p>

<p style="font-family:calibri;color:AAA7AE;font-size:60%;text-align:center"> Based on the results of my tests below and experience of being self employed for over 15 years now I have developed more of a managerial <br>approach to problem solving as im the head lead at our family company. So looking at the big picture is important and carries with it a lot of responsibility. <br>I have always been a keen believer in team effort as I grew up with the mentality of working in a family business. In the team scenario I will<br> maybe try and be direct and try and make major decisions relatively quickly early in the assignment. So as to give people plenty of time to work <br>on their part of the project. Slow and in-decisive meetings will only hold up the production process and we are on a time schedule. <br> Depending on the scenario and my position in the team I would try and give plenty of justifications for my arguments <br>in order to help speed up brain storming sessions. </p>
